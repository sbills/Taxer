tax software with gui

This project began as a request from someone I knew that needed some software to calculate taxes for their business becuase the off the shelf software available was not helping them. What it does is takes in user input and totals them up. It also sorts the input based on counties chosen by the user. (available through a drop down menu for different columns) It also prints out all of the information that has been inputted and calculated into a text file that can be printed out. This solves the issue of doing all the work by hand. It has a user friendly GUI and is written in Java.
